    <p7>HASSANAMBHA TEMPLE</p7>
    <hr color="orange"/>
    
      <img src="image/hsn/hassanambha.jpg" >
      <p1>
        Hasanamba temple is a Hindu temple located in Hassan, Karnataka, dedicated to the Goddess Shakti or Amba. The temple was built in the 12th century and tourists are only allowed to visit the temple once a year during the Hindu festival Deepavali in October. 
        Devotees visit the temple to seek blessings of the Goddess during this week.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Archeological experts consider the Hasanamba Temple to be an example of the epitome of temple architecture in Karnataka. 
        
        The city of Hassan dates to the 11th century and the temples around Hassan signify the various dynasties that have ruled ever since the 11th century. 
        It was originally built by the Hoysala dynasty in their tradition, reflecting their faith in Jainism. The temples in the Hassan district are some of the examples of the Hoysala tradition of temple architecture.
        <br>
        <br>
        The temple is unusual in that it is open to the devotees only for a week every year.
        For the remainder of the year, the Goddess is left with a lit lamp, flowers, water and two bags of rice as an offering until the next year. The nandaa deepa, burns for the entire duration of the temple closure, with the ghee never depleting. The anna naivedya offered to the devi at the time of closing the temple is warm and unspoiled when the doors are opened again, a year later. 
        It is revered as a great temple in Hasana.

    <img src="image/hsn/Kedareshwara_temple.jpg">
    <p1>
      Kedareshwara Temple also spelt as "Kedaresvara" or "Kedareshvara" is a Hoysala era construction in the historically important town of Halebidu, in the Hassan district of Karnataka state, India.
      It is located a short distance away from the famous Hoysaleswara Temple. The temple was constructed by Hoysala King Veera Ballala II ( 1173â€“1220 A.D.) and his Queen Ketaladevi, and the main deity is Ishwara.
      The temple is protected as a monument of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India    <br>
       <br>
     Since the temple has three shrines, it qualifies as a trikuta, a three shrined structure. Often in trikutas, only the central shrine has a tower while the lateral shrines are virtually hidden behind the thick outer walls and appear to be a part of the hall itself  <br>
     The image of the deity of worship is missing in all three sanctums and the superstructure over all three shrines are lost. Some noteworthy pieces of sculpture worthy of mention are the dancing Bhairava , Govardhana  the god Vishnu as Varadaraja, and a huntress.
        
     According to art historian Adam Hardy, the temple was constructed before 1219 A.D and is constructed with Soap stone. The usage of Soap stone was first popularised by the Western Chalukyas before it became standard with the Hoysala architects of the 12th and 13th centuries

      The Lakshmi Narasimha temple was built in 1246 CE by Bommanna Dandanayaka, a commander in the Hoysala Empire during the rule of King Vira Someshwara. It is a good example of 13th-century Hoysala architecture. Located a short distance away in Nuggehalli, and built around the same time is the Sadashiva temple.
       The town was called Vijaya Somanathapura in ancient times and gained importance as an agrahara (place of learning) during the time of Bommanna Dandanayaka. Nuggehalli, is a town in Hassan district of Karnataka, India.

      Mallitamma's sculptures are on the north side. According to him, while they are not as fine, they are lively and have greater variety. The three shrines contain the images of Venugopala, Keshava and Lakshminarasimha, all avatars of Vishnu.
       <br>
       <br>

       According to art critic Gerard Foekema, the temple is of a "newer" Hoysala style, and below the superstructure of the vimana where the roof meets the outer walls of the temple, two eaves all round the temple
