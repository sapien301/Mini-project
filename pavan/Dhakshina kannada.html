        besides the primary deity, there are other idols like Dharma Daivas and Shakti or Ammanavaru as well as the four Guardian Spirits of Lord Dharma such as Kalarkayi, Kanyakumari, Kalarahu and Kumaraswamy.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is an interesting story associated with the temple. The area was ideally in a village called Kuduma in Belthangady. The famous Jain Bunt chief – Birmanna Pergade, used to reside in his house Nelliadi Beedu along with his wife, Ammu Ballalthi. <br>
        <br>
        As legend has it, one fine day, the four guardian angels of Lord Dharma masked themselves as human beings and entered the house. They were on a quest of Dharma preaching and propagation and received a very warm welcome in return. They even requested the chieftain to vacate the house, which the former accepted.
        <br>
        Finally, they ended up making separate shrines for the 4 Daivas as well. <br>

      <br>
      <br>
      The highest point in the National Park is the Kudremukh peak which is around 1892 meters high. The opulence of the soils is perfect for the growth of lush greenery, hence most of the park is filled with evergreen forests and green grasses. Many flowering plants like the Orchids are found here.
      <br>
      <br> 
      The hill station is also popular pilgrim center, with many sacred ponds located in the nearby areas, which makes it a popular pilgrim location in Chikkamangaluru. Naga theertha, Amba theertha, Varaha theertha, Vashishta theertha and Rudra theertha are some of the attractions for pilgrims.

    <p5> TANNIRBHAVI BEACH </p5>
    <hr color="orange"/>
    <img src="image/dk/tannir1.jpg">
    <p1>
     This is the perfect place for the peace and nature lover. Well, Tannirbhavi is the quietest and offbeat location that people generally fail to visit. The place has all remained desolate and has always been kept apart from other places, just because of the isolated region.   
    <br>
    <br>
    Well, it’s pretty safe here. If you are looking to experience a peace of mind, with the utmost serenity, then this is the righteous place that you must never afford to miss.
    <br>
    The beach offers you an unruffled state, just enjoying the sunset in the evening. The only route to visit the beach is by road; it is quite close to Gurupura River or from the Sultan Battery.
    <br>
    <br>
    The beach only lately gained a lot of popularity with the installation of modern facilities like proper washrooms, parking spaces, lifeguards and several eatery stalls. A couple of concrete benches and sheds have also been installed and tall light masts are placed, for the safety and convenience of the tourists.  </p1>

  <p6>MALLALLI FALLS</p6>
  <hr color="orange"/>
  <img src="image/dk/malliali.jpg">
  <p1>
    The Mallalli Falls is located in the Western Ghats at the foot of the Pushpagiri range. This falls about 25km from Somwarpet in the Kodagu district of Karnataka.
    <br>
    <br>
    Mallali Falls are fed by the Kumaradhara River 
    <br>
    The hills around the Mallalli Falls are very popular with trekkers. 
    <br>
    The hillside paths are quite narrow and are flanked by beautiful hillsides which adds to the beauty of this trek. However, if you are planning to trek down this route, wear long trousers with a cuffed hem and sneakers as there are many leeches in the area.    <br>
    <br>
    
    The best time to plan a visit to the Mallalli Falls is post monsoon between the months of July and December. At this point of time, the water levels are at their highest and gush down the hillside in full force. The landscape is also a lush green at this time and adds to the natural beauty of the area.
