      Considered to be one of the most famous pilgrimage sites in South India, the Krishna Temple or the Udupi Sri Krishna Matha is one of the most auspicious temples dedicated to Lord Krishna.The Udupi Krishna temple is a storehouse of legends and stories.The Vaishnavite Jagadguru and founder of the Dvaita school of Vedanta, Shri Madhwacharya founded this religious shrine in the 13th century.  The idol of Krishna is adorned with jewels and a golden chariot. What makes the temple unique, is its worshipping pattern. The prayers and process of the whole worship take place only through a silver-plated window with nine holes called the Navagraha Kitiki. A temple known as Udupi Anantheshwara Temple surrounds the Shree Krishna Matha. This temple traces back to 1,000 years.The temple bears a resemblance to a living ashram, fostering daily life and devotion. It is also the birthplace of Daasa Sahitya, a Udupi form of literature. Every two years, the administration and temple offerings are managed cyclically between the eight mathas. They are collectively known as Ashta Mathagalu.
